# TomexReanimate

A fast, clean reanimation hub made by ExplanationFalse (me) and Xiba.

# How it works

1. Execute this script in your Roblox executor:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hTponer343/TomexReanimate/main/Obfuscated%20(3).lua"))()
```

2. Go to the scripts tab and click any script

3. Wait a few seconds and it should be executed

You can get the discord link by pressing P on your keyboard.

Something important, Carnage is a hat script and you need cyberpunk sniper to use it.

# Exploits it works with

KRNL

Synapse

Wearedevs, EasyExploits and any other dlls most likely will not work.
